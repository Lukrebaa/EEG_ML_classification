# Information about the project <br/>
This is code for EEG signal processing, feature extraction and machine learning classification. <br/>
The code was written in python.<br/>
I tried to leave comments in the code so that those can also understand who are only starting to learn the machine learning. <br/>
The dataset used for the project can be found on this website: https://repod.icm.edu.pl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18150/repod.0107441 <br/>
The dataset contains data from healthy subjects and people suffering from schizophrenia.
